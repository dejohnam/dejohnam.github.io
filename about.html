				<p>Originally from the Flint-area in Michigan, I'm currently a PhD Student in Human Geography at the University of Toronto.
            I got my MA in Human Geography at UofT as well, defending my thesis on transit access to SNAP stores in the Midwest United States in August 2019.
            My BA is from Michigan State University's James Madison College where I studied Political Theory & Constitutional Democracy.
            I had an additional major in Economic Geography as well as a minor in Geographic Information Sciences. <a href="/maps">See some of my maps.</a><br />
					
				Since arriving at University of Toronto, I've been focusing on health and transportation geographies using quantitative methods.
				These have included using OpenTripPlanner to evaluate transit access to subsidized food. More recently, I've been exploring
				machine learning applicatoins to cities. <a href:"http://ontology.eil.utoronto.ca/CEM1002/pipe-flint.html">Click here for a recent case study
					I completed about replacing lead pipes in Flint, MI.</a><br />
				Below are some photos from my travels and activities this past year!<br />
